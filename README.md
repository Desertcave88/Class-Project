19. Patient Fees
This program should be designed and written by a team of students. Here are some
suggestion s:
• One or more students may work on a single class.
• The requirements of the program should be analyzed so each student is given
about the same workload.
• The names, parameters, and return types of each function and class member
function should be decided in advance.
• The program will be best implemented as a multifile program.
Write a program th at comp utes a patient's bill for a hospital sta y. The different
components of the program are
• The PatientAccount class will keep a total of the patient's charges. It will also
keep track of the number of days spent in the hospital. The group must decide on
th e hospital's daily rate.
• The Surgery class will have stored within it the charges for at least five types of
surgery. It can update the charges variable of the Pat i entAccount class.
• The Pharmacy class will have stor ed within it th e price of at least five types of
medication. It can updat e the charges variable of the Pat i entAccount class.
• The main program.
The student who designs the main program will design a menu that allows the user to
enter a type of surgery, enter one or more types of medication, and check the patient
out of the hospital. When the patient checks out, the total charges should be displayed.
